# Opgave-12
Two dice simulations

This code will simulate the distribution of the sum of two dice.
The dice will have a value of 1-6, and the program will perform 50.000 simulations

1. The "simulate" function will call the "dice_throw" function
2.  The "dice_throw" function will simulate a random dice throw and return the sum of the two dice
3.  "simulate" will store the sum in an array
4.  repeat 1-3 the specified amount of times
5.  print the array
